# Audio Player

## Intro
This is an audio player that takes different audio sources (streamed audio files, videos, etc.) and puts them 
into a playlist to easily stream audio from different sources automatically.

## Inspiration
I like listening to different music that are streamable but unless I download the files and put them in an app
like VLC, I'm not able to put them in a playlist and autoplay the files.

## Features
- Play audio with full controls (rewinding, scrubbing, playback speed)

## Upcoming features
- Adding visualization for audio
- Adding different audio sources
